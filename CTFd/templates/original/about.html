In order to encourage the youth to participate, they need to be taught at a young age about the importance of computer security.A lot of research have been proven to be the best way to approach this is Capture the Flag style contests. In cyber security, Capture the Flag is a computer security contest.These contests typically simulate real life scenarios that enable participants to develop real world security skills. Many of the countries like USA and China have realized the need for cyber security education and are conducting CTF contests for school students. Having realized the dire need for such a training culture in India, Team YUKTI has designed an online customizable Capture the Flag style contest specifically designed to introduce cyber security awareness and training  for students in Technical Institutions.") }}</p>
